## Photo Slides

### Introduction
I've been into digitizing analog media and mostly working on hi8 video cassettes as it was of the highest personal value for me and very easy beacause I already have all equipment needed.

My grandparents were getting rid of their bulky waste and therefore looking through the old stuff in their basement. They asked me what to do with their old dia projector. I thought, couldn't you use it for easier digitizing of their old photo slides and sure I found the following: 


### The digitization process

Projector also by Braun
https://www.photoinfos.com/Fotolabor-digital/Dias-2-Projektor-modifizieren-zum-Abfotografieren-von-Dias.htm
Used normal lamp (not lower brightness one or led from above like in blog)
and 0.1mm teflon

TODO: image (everything, lens removed)
TODO: camera settings

extension tubes to convert lens to macro

### Problems
Contrast
Out of camera JPEGs can't handle it well and loose information
Set camera to save RAW and develop them (I like RawTherapee (FOSS), but you can also use darktable (FOSS) or Ligthroom (paid)) 
can do all kinds of stuff
My personal settings:
Edit the tone curve to be almost neutral â†’ keep more information, that would otherwise be clipped
Brighten with a little bit of exposure compensation and by increasing the lightness a bit

images in portrait format
place camera carefully / rotate images 

dust
blow air to clean
can't really do much 
could process them out using software

alignment of the slides in the projector isn't perfect
use auto focus (the projector has auto focus for it's projection too, which just does nothing without the lens)
don't crop all the way, leave some slight borders
could use software to automatically detect the borders and crop apporpriately
need to crop tightly enough so no stray light interferes with the auto-crop



## Fixing over-exposed images

In Exposure tab:
lower exposer compensation
if needed also lower lightness

adjust colors


## Conclusion
High quality technically the capture resolution could be higher but at the point of diminishing returns.
Can fix images with wrong white balance
