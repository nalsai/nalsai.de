# What is a Goshuin?

Goshuin (御朱印) are stamps that are collected in a book called a Goshuincho (御朱印帳). They are collected at shrines and temples in Japan. They are usually collected at the main hall of the shrine or temple. The stamps are usually accompanied by a calligraphy of the name of the shrine or temple and the date of the visit. The stamps are usually collected in a book called a Goshuincho (御朱印帳).

# How to collect Goshuin

You can buy a Goshuincho at most shrines and temples. They usually cost around 1,000 yen.

When you visit a shrine or temple, you can ask for a Goshuin (御朱印お願いします。goshuin onegai shimasu). You will be asked to pay a small fee (usually 300 or 500 yen) and you will be given a Goshuin.

The place where you can get a Goshuin is usually marked with a sign that says either 御朱印所, or  .
Just look for the 印 and you will find the place. Some temples and shrines do not offer Goshuin (temples belonging to the Jōdo Shinshū school of buddhism do not) but most do.


There are pre-made Goshuin and Goshuin that are written on the spot. Many places offer both, so you can get it written in your Goshuincho if you have it with you and if you forgot it you can get it on paper to paste into your Goshuincho later.


At some places (especially if they are crowded or expected to be crowded) they will give you a number and you will have to wait until your number is called to get your Goshuincho with the Goshuin in it.

# Manners when collecting Goshuin

You typically get your Goshuin at the end of your visit after you have made your offering and said your prayers.
Hand over your Goshuincho, ideally opened to the first blank page (where your Goshuin is going to be written), and your money.
Usually you pay after you get your Goshuin, but some places will ask you to pay first.

When you collect your Goshuin, you should bow and say thank you (ありがとうございます。arigatou gozaimasu).
