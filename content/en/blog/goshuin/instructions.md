High quality scan cropped to either 11:16 or 12:18 (= 2:3) aspect ratio (= the most common sizes of Goshuincho)

you can letterbox the image if you need to (add white bars to the top and bottom of the image to make it fit one of the aspect ratios).

data in the following format:

```json
{
    "type": "shrine",
    "name": "",
    "image": "2023-09-_shiba-daijingu.jpg",
    "prefecture": "Tōkyō",
    "location": "Shiba Daijingū",
    "locationJp": "芝大神宮",
    "limited": "",
    "notes": "shrine festival",
    "date": "2023-09-TODO"
}
```

Scan in 600 DPI (or higher)
Original resolution, which should be at least TODO

If you can and it makes sense, save the image as a
JPG with a quality setting of 100% (I know that JPG 100% is stupid) with 4:4:4 chroma subsampling, if possible.

I will resize and compress the images for the website and save the original images for archival purposes and in case I ever want to change something.

Send it via email to <contact@nalsai.de>

You can upload files for example to
https://litterbox.catbox.moe/
(please set the expiration to 3 days, so I have enough time to download it, in case I don't see the email right away)

You can also open a pull request on GitHub if you know how to do that.
