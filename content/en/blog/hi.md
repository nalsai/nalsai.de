Hey ðŸ‘‹,  
as you probably just found out, I have a blog section here now.  
I will try to treat it more like a note collection than a blog, because otherwise I would have too high demands on myself and never publish anything.

Anyway, I recently wrote my first program in rust (<https://git.nalsai.de/imgname>), so here is a simple hello world:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello world!");
}
```

and here is a picture of a rose I took yesterday:
