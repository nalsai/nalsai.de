Today (2022-06-06) I came back to my shared appartment to find my ice cream stolen again.
I've lost almost 10 ‚Ç¨ worth of ice cream now. So I decided that I need to do something about it.

I would like to put a micro controller in there to document when someone tries to steal my ice cream again. However with no power, freezing temperatures (it's ice cream) and no space that is pretty difficult.
I could just buy ice cream that only I like and the others don't, but that would mean giving up on my right to eat whatever ice cream I want.

So I did the next best thing: I decided to design an ice cream lock.

## Designing the 

First I needed to measure my ice cream pint. Here are the measurements for the 400g/460ml H√§agen-Dazs ice cream pint:

## Deciding on a lock

Obviously, I don't want too big padlocks, so I chose to get a 4 pack of 
I used 2 padlocks per ice cream pint to make my design simpler and avoid adding a hinge.
And just for fun I tried to pick the locks with some cheap chinese lockpicking equippement.
While an experienced lockpicker might open the lock with ease, they are enough for my ice cream.

## Extra security

protect the bottom
As many people have pointed out on already existing ice cream locks, you can just get to the ice cream through the bottom. Obviously that's a bit messy and nobody would do it. (The ice cream lock is more important symbolically than as actual protection anyway.) Still, being the perfectionist I am, I needed to design a way to protect the bottom too.

## Closing thoughts

I'd still like to design a smart system, but for now my ice cream is defintely secure.
As a side benefit, the ice cream locks hold the lid of the ice cream closed properly, even if you've already opened it once (it's a bit loose without). Also, I've added a nice message to put ontop of the lid, inside the lock.

Here is the final design, with and without protection for the bottom:
