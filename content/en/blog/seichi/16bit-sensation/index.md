16bit Sensation is a manga and anime series about Akisato Konoha, an illustrator who loves bishōjo games. She winds up in the past, in the year 1992, just as the bishōjo game industry was beginning to flourish.

While it is set in Akihabara, there are suprisingly few real world locations that appear in the anime and can be visited.
With the help of [tamacake (たまかけ)'s blog post](https://tamacake.hatenablog.com/entry/2023/12/22/011727), I was visited some of the locations and took some photos.

This is the sidewalk in front of the Akihabara Daibiru. In the back, you can see the bridge for the train tracks.

The Mister Donut is quite a memorable location in the anime. Sadly, it has now closed down. I went there a couple of times before it closed, it was a nice place to relax, have a snack and look at the street.
Since there were other customers, I didn't take any photos inside. Only from the outside and my food.

On the right, you can see Kyūshū Jangara Akihabara, where Konoha and Kaori went to eat ramen in episode 4. It seems to be very popular, as there was always a line of people waiting to get in.

In the area, you can also find this building which looks somewhat similar to this scene in episode 1.
