Last fall I visited Fukui, a city on the west coast of Japan, because I was inspired by the light novel series "Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle", written by Hiromu and illustrated by raemz.

The [4th collaboration event](https://fuku-iro.jp/chiramune2024) between the light novel and the city of Fukui was held from 2024-08-23 to 2024-10-20 so that was the perfect time to go there.  
Since the original is a light novel, there are not many pictures to recreate, so I thought I'd make this post more of a trip report, which is why I am also including this in the Japan category and not just Anime Tourism.

Even though I lived in Mie at the time, I went there from Tokyo because the Hokuriku Shinkansen had only recently been extended to Tsuruga.

## Fukui Station

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="fb35fd39-db1b-4b0b-b665-630a5d0b08a5" >}}

I arrived at Fukui Station just before 15:00 with the shinkansen from Ueno and was greeted by many dinosaurs.
The city of Fukui is known for its dinosaur fossils and also calls itself the "Dinosaur Kingdom".

They even moved and made sounds. One of them frequently roars at passersbys.  
The dinosaur square in front of the station appears in volume 4 as a meeting place for Yūko and Chitose on a date.

Also at the station, paper standees of the characters from the light novel were displayed inside the station building, and at the tourist information center in front of the station, the characters from Chiramune could be seen:  
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="f7b27be6-2f2e-4d2b-b3bf-2810cae2bb73" >}}
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="a8bcccb9-b7b3-4b34-8102-dfd94ae04eb5" >}}

But before exploring the city, I went to my hotel to check in and drop off my luggage (although it was just a backpack).
On the way, I encountered construction work on the street that had information and images about Chiramune on the fence.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="18338ec8-2f02-426c-8a8f-a32364d5ba29" >}}

After checking in, I quickly made my way to Mt. Asuwa before the sun would set.

This museum I passed on the way is dedicated to American educator William Elliott Griffis (1843–1928). It was part of the Chiramune digital stamp rally.
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="b5ccc2b6-aa51-4920-be2e-a75ad110c647" >}}

## Mt. Asuwa

Mt. Asuwa is located in the center of Fukui and is a popular spot for cherry blossom viewing in spring.
It also gives a nice view of the city and, among other things, has a nature museum and a small free zoo. In the light novel, it is said that Saku visited them when he was little.

The historic staircase Atagozaka leads up to the mountain.  
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="ea9694e9-713f-40d7-9c7b-d325b6e37493" >}}
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="f7b03748-39da-4d9c-a62c-80254dca950a" >}}

Along the way, I got a nice view of the east side of the city.  
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="711a0b9b-a635-478d-96ee-fc7896d58da0" >}}

Around the top of the mountain, a statue of Emperor Keitai, the 26th Emperor of Japan (reigned 507–531) greeted me.  
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="bdb86408-86d1-472c-8225-8a42dc5685ba" >}}

Arriving at the observation deck, I found it to be quite lush with greenery; you could just see the north-western part of the city through the trees.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="1dd4d9f1-a56e-43eb-b96e-4f526b3f8181" >}}

Here, Saku confesses to Haru about the events that took place in the baseball team.

## Asuwa Riveside

Coming back down, I walked along the river to the east side of the city.
The sun was setting, giving the city a warm glow.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="5ed6507a-9392-44f8-8e99-d1cb10703528" >}}

## Eiheiji Temple

The next day I went to Eiheiji Temple, which is located in the mountains to the east of Fukui.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="7626b7a0-d6bc-4218-bd85-acb6e9feade7" >}}

Visiting this grand temple complex was quite the experience.
It is one of two main temples of the Sōtō school of Zen Buddhism, the largest single religious denomination in Japan.

## Ichijodani Asakura Family Historic Ruins

I then took the bus south to the Ichijodani Asakura Family Historic Ruins, which are the historic remains of a castle town.
Due to having used wood for construction, we are very lucky that the ruins were preserved and later excavated.
During the Sengoku period, the town had over 10,000 inhabitants and was the center of the Asakura clan's territory.
After losing a battle against Oda Nobunaga in 1573, the town burned down.

Starting in 1967, under the lead of archaeologist Ono Masatoshi planned agricultural development was stopped after various artifacts were found, and the ruins were excavated.
Residences of samurai as well as merchants' quarters were restored along the 200 meter long street. Four Japanese gardens were unearthed and partially restored and designated as Places of Scenic Beauty in 1991.
At the ruins, Approximately 1,700,000 relics were found, 2,343 of which are designated as Important Cultural Properties.

Get transported back in time by walking through the ruins and seeing the restored buildings and gardens. You can really feel the history of the place.

During the Chiramune event, there was a stamp rally at the ruins. I got a keychain as a reward for completing it.  
They also have a cute mascot character, which you can see on this manhole cover.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="c2c67431-36ca-4ec7-a611-867c93645fce" >}}

With that, the day already came to an end, and I went back to the city.

## Lpa

Since it was not too late yet, I went to Lpa the large shopping mall that often appears in the light novel.  
If you've ever lived in the Japanese countryside, you know these kinds of malls.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="cb1c0b8b-09d7-4c72-86c7-54f037b1785f" >}}

Inside the mall, you can find the bookstore AKUSHU BOOK&BASE. As part of the Chiramune collaboration event, they had a special corner with the light novel and a bunch of merchandise.
I bought a bunch and got a Chriramune x Fukui map here. (You could also get it at the tourist information center at the station.)

## Akiyoshi

My dinner was at Yakitori no Meimon Akiyoshi, a large yakitori restaurant chain originating from Fukui that also appears in the light novel.  
Saku goes to the Akiyoshi in front of Fukui Station with Kura in volume 3.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="2b55c7a9-c413-453e-a38d-17492e0f9a8c" >}}

## Fukui Castle Site

On my last day in Fukui, I first walked around the city to visit some more locations I hadn't visited during the day yet.

In the center of the city, Fukui Castle used to be located. After the main keep burned down in 1669, it was ultimately destroyed in 1871. Now the Fukui Prefectural Government Office stands on the site.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="7802878c-aae5-4c6f-865d-46b98a32de22" >}}

## Yōkōkan Garden

North-east of the castle site is the Yōkōkan Garden, which is a traditional Japanese garden.
It doesn't appear in the light novel but is highly recommended to visit by the author. It was also a spot in the digital stamp rally.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="2b50925c-d6f6-4e40-9d60-bfcc6df02e70" >}}

## Arakawa Riverside

I then walked to the Arakawa Riverside, which is the setting for many of the memorable scenes in the story as it is part of the main characters' school route.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="f83380b3-181c-4f75-a0e6-0f63bf545d04" >}}

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="ead9bb11-001e-4dd8-aa83-b3098fe526dd" >}}

## Sugimori Shirahige Shrine

In volume 2, chapter 2, Saku and Yuzuki went to the spring festival here on a date, the day after Yuzuki and Haru played a practice match.  
In May, a spring festival like the one in the story is held.  
Furthermore, the "Couple Ginkgo Tree" that appeared in the story is also real.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="9f3a63ec-2117-4e67-ba84-ee112536af78" >}}

To get a goshuin I had to call the priest with my phone, who then came to the shrine with a really cute dog. I wish I had taken a picture.

## Yoroppa-ken

Yoroppa-ken is a popular restaurant chain local to Fukui prefecture (even though it apparently first opened in Tokyo) serving Katsudon pork cutlet.
Yoroppa being the Japanese pronunciation of "Europe", it has a distinct European flair to it. (After living in Japan for a year, I was unsure how much of it was actually European and how much was just a Japanese interpretation of European.)
Well, what matters is that the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice.

Team Chitose visited the restaurant in volume 2, chapter 3, but it also appears a couple more times.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="a6a4a289-bdb3-40bf-b186-cb255399ee9c" >}}

Right next to it is Higashi Park, which also appears in the light novel a bunch of times. In the first volume, Haru and Saku play basketball here.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="54b73eab-d42b-4a37-a623-7f8acb2e900e" >}}

## Tōjinbō

Tōjinbō is a scenic series of basaltic cliffs on the Sea of Japan in the town of Mikuni, Sakai, Fukui Prefecture. They are part of the Echizen-Kaga Kaigan Quasi-National Park.
It is not part of my Chiramune piligrimage, but I wanted to see it since it is a popular tourist spot in Fukui.

I took the Echizen Railway from Fukui Station to Mikuni Station and then used the bus to get to the cliffs.
The Echizen Railway Fukui Station is quite an interesting building. I think it looks really cool with how you can see inside the building and watch the train(s) inside.  
{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="3a8cbbbb-fdb0-4981-9490-bd4046304ae5" >}}

The ride was calming going through the fields in the countryside. They also have nice train attendants.  
Overall, a pleasant experience with a very local feel to it.

{{< img-immich immich="nJu-wZ_YHJOx-DCo8mjFXbLgTXcrUhpHfJqnLiuT3YTQZNbC2lZMfXWYAkIAWYUj9iQ" img="84c40ef6-1990-45e7-9751-89e4776b711b" >}}

---

And with that, my short trip to Fukui came to an end.
Before leaving, I went to the small shopping center Happiring in front of the station. Here, Saku, Kazuki and Kenta visit Burger King after Animate in volume 3, and Saku, Yuko, Atomu, and Nazuna go on a double date, which is illustrated in volume 4.
The souvenir shop FukuFukuKan on the 2nd floor apparently sells Chiramune collaboration merchandise all year round.

Since I still had some time left before my train, I went to have a snack at Yutori Coffee (AOSSA). This is also the place that Saku and his friends visited for a break.

I hope you enjoyed this trip report, and maybe it will inspire you to visit Fukui as well. I think it is quite underrated as a tourist destination in Japan and just in general.  
I definitely want to come back, and when the anime adaptation airs, I will be sure to watch it and plan my next visit.
