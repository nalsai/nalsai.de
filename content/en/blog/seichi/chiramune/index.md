Last fall I visited Fukui, a city on the west coast of Japan, because I was inspired by the light novel series "Chitose Is in the Ramune Bottle" written by Hiromu and illustrated by raemz.

I wanted to visit it before the end of my study abroad year in Japan 
the 4th collaboration event between the light novel and the city of Fukui was held from 2024年8月23日（金） to 10月20日（日）so that was the perfect time to go there.

Since the original is a light novel, there are no pictures to recreate so I thought I'd make more of a trip report, which is why I am also including this in the Japan category and not just Anime Tourism.

Because the shinkansen was extended to Tsuruga I decided to go there from Tokyo and not from where I was studying in Mie.

On September 5th, the second to last week of my time in Japan I went 


I had originally planned to stay over the weekend but since I was too late to book a hotel I came a little earlier and left on Friday evening.
