While there is only one place that is known I made sure to go there and take a photo, as Making*Lovers is one of my favorite VNs.

The location is the **Mitsui Outlet Park Makuhari in Chiba**, a shopping mall with a lot of stores and restaurants.
I was in the area multiple times, as the location is close to the Makuhari Messe, a convention center where I attended Tokyo Game Show and niconico Chokaigi.

The photo is not lined up perfectly, as it is just a quick phone shot before niconico Chokaigi, but you can clearly see the resemblance.  
(Also, there is a pole in the way and the geometry is not exactly the same.)
