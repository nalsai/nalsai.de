I actually bought my flight tickets to Japan on the day of the 15th anniversary of Subahibi and visting Tama Center was one of the things I wanted to do for sure on this trip.

I took the Keio Line to Tama Center Station from Shinjuku. I had taken this train once before, when I visited Yomiuri Land, which is located a couple of stops away from Tama Center.
Tama Center Station had lots of cute decorations with Sanrio characters, as Sanrio Puroland is located nearby.

## Tama Center - Maghreb Building from Parthenon Avenue

Sadly, it was raining slightly when I arrived, but I didn't let that stop me.

I never account enough for the different aspect ratio, so my image is missing the signs at the right side of the building even though they are there in reality too.

Here is the non-cropped version of the image (I still cut off slightly more than in the original Subahibi image):

This was very hard to line up. When I was there, I thought it looked quite different from the image in Subahibi, but after lining them up in GIMP, I realized that it is actually quite similar.
I think, the bridge behind the image makes it feel quite open while the harsh shadows in combination with the buildings in the Subahibi image give it a more back-alley like feel.
