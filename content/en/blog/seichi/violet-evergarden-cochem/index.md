The location of the movie "Violet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memory Doll" is based on the town of Cochem in Germany.
I visited the town and took pictures of the locations that appear in the movie.

Cochem is easily accessible by train, so it makes for a great trip even without a car. The town is small and you can walk to most of the locations in the movie.
If you come from Koblenz, make sure you sit on the left side of the train to see the Mosel river similar to Violet's journey.

I came from Mannheim using the RE1 without any additional costs, thanks to my student Deutschlandticket. On the way back I went to Koblenz, but I didn't have a window seat, as all window seats on the right side (to see the Mosel) were already taken. Still, I enjoyed the view along the Mosel river from my aisle seat.

### Pinnerkreuz

I went here first, as there is a hiking trail starting from right next to the train station and I wanted to get there before the sun sets.  
The Pinnerkreuz and the hiking trail offer a nice view of the town and the Mosel river.

During tourist season, you can also take the Cochemer Sesselbahn (chairlift) to get up here but as I visited in winter, it was closed.  
The hiking trail takes about 45 minutes to get up there from the train station and 15 minutes down to the start of the chairlift, close to the city center.

## Hinter Kempeln

The second stop on Taylor's first mail delivery tour is at Hinter Kempeln. The area looks different in real life, but the stairs are the same.

This mailbox is somewhere else, but its design is similar to the one in the movie. It's a private mailbox, so you have to find it yourself.

### Bonus: Mailboxes

If you want to send some mail from Cochem, you can find a mailbox on the wall of the city hall at the market square

and a historic blue mailbox at Alte Thorschenke next to the street leading to the bridge.

There's also one in front of the Mosel promenade, but it doesn't have a special design and looks like any other german mailbox.

I bought some postcards at the market square and sent them from the historic blue mailbox.

### Castle

The castle is the most prominent building in Cochem and can be seen from almost everywhere in the town. It's a short walk from the city center to the castle.

The inside of the castle can only be visited with a guided tour, which I couldn't take because it was closed during my visit.
During tourist season, there are tours every day, but in winter, they only take place on some days.

Maybe I'll visit again in the future and take the tour.

No pictures of the courtyard, as it was closed when I visited.

### View from the other side of the river (Uferstraße)

Violet see this view from the train, but in reality the train and all other locations are on the other side of the river.  
You can get this view by crossing the bridge.

The location of this picture is actually right next to where I stayed the night.

### Hatzenport - St. Johannes

You need a car and drive ~15 minutes to the village of Hatzenport to take this picture, so I didn't go there.
Above the townscape from the other side of the river you can see the St. Johannes church.

That's all for now. I hope you enjoyed the pictures, and maybe you'll visit Cochem yourself.

I'm planning to also visit the locations of Violet Evergarden in Heidelberg, Mannheim and Nuremberg in the future and write about them here.

Thanks to J-Junk for the information, I found their *dōjinshi* at Comiket 104, which inspired me to make this trip:
