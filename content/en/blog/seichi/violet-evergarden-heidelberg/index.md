Heidelberg, the fifth-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, has a population of around 163,000, about a quarter of whom are students, myself included.  
One of its most famous landmarks is Heidelberg Castle, which served as the inspiration for the temporary embassy of the Gardarik Empire in episode 13 of Violet Evergarden.

This spot can be visited for free. It is located on the west side of the castle. South of the "Thick Tower".

You can see this building from the courtyard and from the terrace of the castle.  
It looks a little different than in the anime and you can't get exactly the same angle, but it is still recognizable.

As a student, I paid 5,50€ for a ticket to the castle, which also included the funicular railway.
If you get a tour ticket, you can also visit the inside of the castle, but I just missed the last tour of the day because there was some congestion at the funicular railway ticket office.  
Even without a tour, I think the courtyard and the terrace aswell as the German Apocethecary Museum are worth a visit.

Although in the anime it is very snowy, snow has gotten quite rare in Heidelberg in recent years.  
I hope, I get the chance to take a picture of the castle with snow in the future, but for now, I only have pictures from summer.
