I recently visited my uncle in Nuremberg and took the opportunity to explore several real-life locations featured in "Violet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memory Doll".

These spots are conveniently located within walking distance from Nuremberg Central Station. The route to Nuremberg Castle takes about 20 minutes on foot, with all locations along the way.

I sorted them in the order of distance from the station, so you can easily follow the route.

Although this is not the same spot as in the movie, there was also a market. Though it made taking the previous picture a bit difficult, as there were stalls in the way.

I'm still missing this picture, as I walked a different route to the castle, but I will update this post once I have it:
