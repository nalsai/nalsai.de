I don't want to write much except that I had a great time visiting the locations from White Album 2 in Strasbourg.  
It is located fairly close to where I live so I was able to make the trip easily.  
I went there during exam preparation week on Thursday 2025-07-17, visited the locations, spent one night at a hotel and returned home the next day.

## Strasbourg Station

I took the tram from Kehl (the closest station in Germany) to Strasbourg, so I walked to the station after finishing my shots in the city.

## Hotel

While the other locations were pretty much exactly the same, this one is quite different but you can see the inspiration.
