## Introduction

I have been a fan of Yuru Camp since the first season, and I was very excited when the third season was announced. It was releasing while I was in Japan and easily reacheable from my location in Tsu by local and express trains. So I decided to visit the ≈åigawa Railway and the surrounding area.

## The Plan

Since it is a pretty remote area trains are not very frequent, so I had to plan my trip carefully. I carefully checked the train and bus schedules and made a plan for the day so I don't end up stranded in the middle of nowhere.

Starting from my Hotel in Hamamatsu I took the train to Kanaya at 6:23 AM  wher I changed to the ≈åigawa Railway.
Due to typhoon damage in 2022 the train was not running all the way to Senzu, so I had to get off at Ieyama at 7:49 AM and took the community bus to Senzu at 8:15 AM.

From there I took the train to Sessoky≈ç Onsen, where I arrived at 10:28 AM.

The train ride itself was already very scenic and I could see the beautiful valley of the river ≈åi. The announcer in the train also pointed out some of the sights along the way. Unfortunately I could not understand much due to the train noise.

From there I took the *Yappashi Komichi Love Romance Road* as seen in the anime and walked back all the way to Abt-Ichishiro Station to enjoy the sight along the way and then catch the train back to Senzu.

With that let's get to the pictures:

## Afterword

I had a great time visiting the locations from Yuru Camp Season 3 and I can only recommend it to other fans of the series. The area is very beautiful and the train ride is already worth it. Ideally you should plan for a night at one of the Onsen in the area to fully enjoy the experience or you can come with a car or motorbike and camp at Abt Ichishiro Campinground for a more Yuru Camp like experience.
I hope you enjoyed this little trip report and maybe it will inspire you to visit the area yourself.
I'm definitely going to visit again if I get the chance.
