## Introduction

I have been a fan of Yuru Camp since the first season, and I was very excited when the third season was announced. It was releasing while I was in Japan and easily reacheable from my location in Tsu by local and express trains. So I decided to visit the Ōigawa Railway and the surrounding area.

It took a while to get this blog post up, but I actually visited the spots fairly soon after the anime aired (less than two months after the release of episode 3, the episode that features the locations I visited). I hope you enjoy the pictures and the little trip report.

## The Plan

Since it is a pretty remote area trains are not very frequent, I had to plan my trip carefully. I checked the train and bus schedules and made a plan for the day so I wouldn't end up stranded.

Starting from my Hotel in Hamamatsu I took the train to Kanaya at 6:23 AM  wher I changed to the Ōigawa Railway.
Due to typhoon damage in 2022 the train was not running all the way to Senzu, so I had to get off at Ieyama at 7:49 AM and took the community bus to Senzu at 8:15 AM.

From there I took the train to Sessokyō Onsen, where I arrived at 10:28 AM.

The train ride itself was already very scenic and I could see the beautiful valley of the river Ōi. The announcer in the train also pointed out some of the sights along the way. Unfortunately I could not understand much due to the train noise.

From there I took the *Yappashi Komichi Love Romance Road* as seen in the anime and walked back all the way to Abt-Ichishiro Station to enjoy the sights along the way and then catch the train back to Senzu.

With that let's get to the pictures:

## Kanaya Station

The start of the Ōigawa Railway. As I don't have a license I started my journey here, just like Nadeshiko.  
I didn't have the pictures from the anime with me so here are the pictures I freely took.

The train you can see on the right looks similar to the Tōkaido Main Line trains that run there in real life, but the Ōigawa Railway train is a different model than the one I took.

## Yappashi Komichi Love Romance Road

From Kanaya I first went all the way to the Yappashi Komichi Love Romance Road, so I arranged the pictures like that too.

It was quite overgrown, so I didn't recognize it immediately.

Here comes the first of the seemingly endless series bridges:

One bridge isn't accessible, just like in the anime.  
But since we're only at the beggining, we've still got plenty to get through.

It's already getting tiring phtographing all these bridges.

Luckily no water on the bridge for me.

Tsubaki Bridge is what every foreigner thinks of when they think of Japanese bridges.

If I had brought a tripod I could have copied the poses and taken a picture of myself.

That was a nice little walk, with a lot of bridges.  
It took me about 40 minutes from the first bridge to the end, but only because I took a lot of pictures.

## Nagashima Dam

Inside the small exhibition at the management office there was also a Yuru Camp map but the leaflets were all gone. I wonder if they made a version with the Anime now, because when I was there it was all from the Yuru Camp Manga.  
At Nagashima Dam I also met a group of Japanese tourists who came with their car and were very friendly.

## Abt-Ichishiro Campground

This is the campground where Rin and Nadeshiko stayed in the anime.
It's just a short walk down the road from the Dam.

## Mystery Tunnel

Connecting the Campground and Abt-Ichishiro Station is a pitch black tunnel that is apparently the remains of the old Ikawa line that used to run there before the dam was built. It now has spooky things placed inside so it doesn't get boring walking through it. Don't forget to bring a flashlight or use your phone's flashlight because it really is pitch black inside.

## Abt-Ichishiro

This is the station where the Abt rack railway starts.  
You get off the train here to watch the rack locomotive connect to the train and then take you up the mountain with a maximum gradient of 9%.

## Senzu

Here is where you change between the Ikawa Line and the Ōigawa Main Line or the bus between Senzu Ieyama since part of the line is still closed due to typhoon damage.

Sadly I couldn't try the Dam Curry as it was only available from 11:00 to 16:00 and I was there too early and too late.

I did however get to eat the ice cream like Nadeshiko

### Ryōgoku Tsuribashi

This suspension bridge can be visited with a short walk from Senzu Station. I had just enough time to visit it before my train back to Ieyama.

## Afterword

I had a great time visiting the locations from Yuru Camp Season 3 and I can only recommend it to other fans of the series. The area is very beautiful and the train ride is already worth it. Ideally you should plan for a night at one of the Onsen in the area to fully enjoy the experience or you can come with a car or motorbike and camp at Abt Ichishiro Campinground for a more Yuru Camp like experience.  
I hope you enjoyed this little trip report and maybe it will inspire you to visit the area yourself.
If I have the chance I would love to visit the Ōigawa again and maybe stay a night at one of the Onsen.
