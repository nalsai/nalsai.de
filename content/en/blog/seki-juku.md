On December 14 I went to Seki-juku (Seki Post Town) with a friend.

We rode out bikes to Tsu Station and then took the JR Kisei Line to Kameyama, where we had to change trains to the Kansai Line.
The Kansai Line going to Seki Station was a very short (single-car) diesel multiple unit (DMU) train, model KiHa 120.

As it was a very small local train we couldn't pay with our Suica IC cards which was a bit confusing.

It runs to Kamo Station in Kyōto Prefecture, where passengers can switch to the Yamatoji Line to Nara and Ōsaka, which is technically part of the Kansai Main Line connecting JR Namba Station in Ōsaka with Nagoya Station.

The Kintetsu lines outcompeted the Kansai Main Line, which is why it is split that way.

Walking through Seki-juku, the streets were pretty quiet, with only a few people strolling around creating a calming atmosphere.

Following the Meiji Restoration, Seki-juku became the nucleus for the modern town of Seki, which became part of the city of Kameyama in 2005. Many of the historical buildings have been preserved and the area has been designated as Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings.

I think I prefer my pillow over a wooden headrest

Seki Machinami Museum

Showed
the "hole in the sealing" to let in light (they didn't have windows like today)

we walked to the "beginning" of Seki in the East to see the big Torii

because
Sekijuku was also located at the beginning of the Ise-betsu Kaido road, which leads on to the Ise Kaido road used by people pilgrimaging to Ise Grand Shrine from the Kansai direction.

Seki Jizō-in Temple

Mie Prefecture-grown non-glutinous and glutinous rice and Mie chicken and has a distinctive, pleasantly chewy texture.


The soba noodle soup made with high-quality Hidaka kelp, dried bonito flakes, and several Mie Prefecture soy sauces also has a profound smell and taste. All of the stews, pickles, and other dishes using locally grown vegetables are flavorful masterpieces.

Before we left I bought some Shiratama - mochi rice cake sweets common in the Edo period


The soft-textured and velvety mochi filled with smooth red bean paste gives this treat an elegant taste.
