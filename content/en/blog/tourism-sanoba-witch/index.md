Welcome back to another pilgrimage! This time, I visited places from the Yuzusoft visual novels Senren*Banka (released in 2016) and Sanoba Witch (released in 2018). Since the two visual novels settings take inspiration from Ky≈çto, I visited them together. This is the page for Sanoba Witch. You can find the [Senren*Banka Pilgrimage by following this link](../tourism-senren-banka).

Now that we're at the end, it's time to link others who have also made a similar pilgrimage.
