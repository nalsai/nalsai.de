Welcome back to another pilgrimage! This time, I visited places from the Yuzusoft visual novels Senren*Banka (released in 2016) and Sanoba Witch (released in 2018). Since the two visual novels settings take inspiration from Kyōto, I visited them together. This is the page for Senren*Banka. You can find the [Sanoba Witch Pilgrimage by following this link](../tourism-sanoba-witch).

The village of Hoori lies deep in the middle of the mountains, inaccessible by rail. Since there isn’t much interaction with its surroundings, the town seems like it is stuck in the past. However, it is because of this exact olden feel and subsequent development that it has turned into a nice hot-springs town for tourists. 


Senren*Banka is set in an idyllic village untouched by modernization. It boasts a traditional Japanese-style landscape and a hot spring resort.



I recommend getting the Bus day ticket, which I forgot. A bicycle would also be handy.

The atmosphere of Hoori in Senren*Banka and Kyōto are quite different, but I think it's still worth visiting if you're a fan of the visual novel.

Kyōto tourist spots are pretty but crowded
outside of the tourist spots, it's pretty quiet but also much less pretty.
