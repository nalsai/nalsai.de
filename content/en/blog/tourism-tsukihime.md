## Introduction

Tsukihime is a Japanese visual novel created by Type-Moon, who first released it at the Winter Comiket in December 2000.  
It is set in the fictional Misaki Town, located on the outskirts of the Kantō region. However, the actual backgrounds are edited photos from Tokyo, and most places can still be visited more than 20 years later.
As a big fan of Tsukihime, I decided to visit some of the places and take photos.

(In the Tsukihime Remake series, Misaki Town is replaced with Souya, located in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. I will not be covering Tsukihime Remake, as I have not read it yet.)

## Hibiya Park

I first visited Hibiya Park during the day, and the next day I went there again at night. (As it was close to my hotel, I actually came by a couple more times.)

### The Fountain

I assume that the image in Tsukihime was taken during the day, but I think it looked better at night.
The fountain jets have probably been replaced, so it looks a bit different.
Due to the fountain jets being higher, I took the photo further upward than the one in Tsukihime.
Maybe, with the right timing, it would be possible to get a photo more similar to the one in Tsukihime.  
Also, I have no clue from which angle the photo was taken, as the trees obviously look different now.

I also took a short video of the fountain at night: <https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNmrFuproa0wQsEfc7w8rKn28urgPjKw22ODQvSwSBkQTR7vQBLFqiXcVZBPUKUfg/photo/AF1QipOrgg7LRwcx9fnnXLbOrzReKxqQn7XMgIoO4Qso?key=M0t3YUNoRTZsZkJkZ0RGY3piblZDZWd1ejdMYlZn>

## The path with the trees

There was construction going on, so the view of the trees was blocked. The original photo was probably taken the winter, hoping seeing as the trees are bare. So even if there had been no construction, it would not have looked the same.

I will come back in winter hoping that I can get a better photo then.

The path leads to Hibiya Public Hall:

Afterward, I walked to the Sukiyaba Crossing in Ginza.

## The Sukiyabashi Crossing in Ginza

A short walk from Hibiya Park is the Sukiyabashi Crossing in Ginza, right next to Yurakucho.

It has a nice vibe at night, with the big Fujiya signboard and the other lights shining brightly.

## Shibuya Modi (previously Shibuya Marui)

The Shibuya Marui has turned into the Shibuya Modi. It is a department store located close to the Shibuya Station.
The shape of the pillars has changed, and they are now covered in plants, but the building is still recognizable.

I only came here for the photo because it was not much of a detour. With the cars and the people, it was hard to get the photo. Also, the rounded shape makes it difficult to find the right angle, but I think I got close enough.

## Bonus 1: The Arc de Triomphe in Paris

These bonus images appear when Shiki dreams about the past of Roa's seventeenth incarnation.

I went to Paris in August 2016 with my family and, of course, visited the Arc de Triomphe. Sadly, I didn't take a photo from the same angle as the one in Tsukihime.

## Bonus 2: The Trevi Fountain in Rome

In July 2019 I went to Rome as part of a school trip. It was very crowded around the fountain, so I couldn't get any closer.

## Afterword

It was a lot of fun to visit these places.
The apartment (in Komae) and the school (in Nerima) are a bit far from the center of Tokyo, so I haven't been there, but I hope to visit them in the future.
Sadly, the Shinjuku Suitomo Building has been renovated, so the place where the battle with Nero took place is now completely different.
Hibiya Park, where a lot of the images of the park in Tsukihime were taken, was pretty close to my hotel and has become one of my favorite parks in Tokyo.
I will definitely go there again and update this blog post with more photos.

When I'm in Kyoto, I plan to visit some places from Senren*Banka next.  
Look forward to another blog post about that!
