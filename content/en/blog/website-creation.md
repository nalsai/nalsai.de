## Short Answer

I don't remember when this website was originally created. I redesigned my website and registered the domain nalsai.de in 2018.  
I originally learned HTML by generating it with OpenOffice and the looking at the source code until I understood it.

## Long Answer

I started out using OpenOffice to generate HTML and then analyzing and improving the markup it created but quickly moved on to completely writing it myself. The website was served by a simple http server that was included in my parents' phone and internet package. The url was anminisa.de/nils. It now just redirects to my current website. Sadly I don't know when I started and I didn't keep any old versions of my website, but I may be able to find something on my parents' old computers. (TODO)

To write the website I've been using Visual Studio Code since it came out in 2015.

In 2018 I completely redesigned the website and used MDBootstrap as a UI toolkit for the first time. Everything before then was completely handwritten so I had trouble with the design not adapting well to different screen sizes. The general design of the website is still pretty similar to how it was when I used MDBootstrap. You can still find an example of that design at <https://royal.nalsai.de/>. The animations on that site were added as a joke and were never part of any other site, although I did use some less obnoxious animations for a short time. For consistency and shared elements across multiple sites, I started using Jekyll, as it is the default of GitHub Pages, which I also started using at the same time. At the end of the year I finally bought the domain nalsai.de, which I have been using ever since. It was registered on 2018-11-27T09:11:00+00:00.

In 2020 I switched to Bootstrap 4 due to better usability and performance. I also switch from Jekyll to Hugo later in 2020 and in 2021 I updated the website to Bootstrap 5.
