Ethernet in House (Installing ethernet in my parent house)

Converting Phone wiring to Gigabit Ethernet
My computer is on the second floor, while the router is on the basement. Because there was no Ethernet wiring in the house, I had to use WiFi to connect the devices. I had a repeater on the first floor and an old Fritz!Box. With this I could at least get 100 Mbit over WiFi (with better equipment probably a bit more). However the problem with wireless technology is that it's not as reliable as using cables. I have tried using Ethernet over Powerline, but while it was more reliable the speed was terrible and there were issues with a ??radio clock??. Additionally, you had to be careful to only plug in devices behind the Powerline connector.
Obviously the best way to connect devices is via cable, that's why I'd been thinking about how I can achieve this for a while. Sadly it's pretty much impossible to install cables in the walls and there are no  ?? wire canals?? I could use, However there is one type of cable in the wall that's not used anymore - old telephone cable. For a while I had been thinking about converting it to Ethernet and during the last vacation I was finally able to convert it.

First I needed to identify where the cables were connected and how they could be used for an Ethernet connection. Luckily, most cables were already 8 wires with twisted pairs. I only had to replace the wire from the second floor to the ??speicher?? (I couldn't have replaced the other anyway).
