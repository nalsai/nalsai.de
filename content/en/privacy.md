## Privacy

We have written this data protection declaration in order to be able to offer you in accordance with the requirements of the [General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&tid=311203132) to explain what information we collect, how we use data and what choices you have as a visitor to this website.

Unfortunately, it is in the nature of things that these explanations sound very technical, but we have tried to describe the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.

## Automatic data storage

* the host name and the IP address of the device from which access is made

As a rule, web server log files are stored for two weeks and then automatically deleted. We do not pass on this data, but we cannot rule out that this data will be viewed in the event of illegal behavior.

## TLS encryption with https

We use https to transfer data securely on the Internet (data protection through technology design [Article 25 Paragraph 1 GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN&tid=311203132)). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You can recognize the use of this data transmission protection by the small lock symbol in the top left of the browser and the use of the https (instead of http) scheme as part of our Internet address.

## Cloudflare privacy policy

We use Cloudflare from Cloudflare, Inc. (101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on this website to make our website faster and safer. Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data. Cloudflare, Inc. is an American company that provides a content delivery network and various security services. These services are located between the user and our hosting provider and act as a [reverse proxy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Proxy) for websites. We will try to explain in more detail below what all this means.

### What is Cloudflare?

A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing more than a network of servers connected via the Internet. Cloudflare has distributed such servers all over the world to bring websites to your screen faster. Simply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on their own servers. When you visit our website now, a load balancing system ensures that most of our website is delivered by the server that can display our website to you the fastest. A CDN significantly shortens the data transmission route to your browser. Thus, the content of our website is delivered to you by Cloudflare not only from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world. The use of Cloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, as the page can be delivered from a server nearby. In addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services such as DDoS protection or the web application firewall.

### Why do we use Cloudflare on our website?

Of course we want to offer you the best possible service with our website. Cloudflare helps us to make our website faster and more secure. Cloudflare offers us both web optimization and security services such as DDoS protection and web firewall. This also includes a [reverse proxy](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Proxy) and the content distribution network (CDN). Cloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots and crawlers that are wasting our bandwidth and server resources. By storing our website on local data centers and blocking spam software, Cloudflare enables us to reduce our bandwidth usage by around 60%. Serving content through a data center near you, and doing some web optimizations there, reduces the average load time of a website by roughly half. According to Cloudflare, the “I'm Under Attack Mode” setting can be used to weaken further attacks by displaying a JavaScript arithmetic task that must be solved before a user can access a website. Overall, this makes our website much more powerful and less susceptible to spam or other attacks.

### What data does Cloudflare save?

Cloudflare generally only forwards the data that is controlled by the website operator. The content is not determined by Cloudflare, but always by the website operator himself. In addition, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and process data that is sent by us or for which Cloudflare has received instructions. In most cases, Cloudflare receives data such as contact information, IP addresses, security fingerprints, DNS log data and performance data for websites that are derived from browser activity. Log data helps Cloudflare, for example, to identify new threats. In this way, Cloudflare can guarantee a high level of security protection for our website. Cloudflare processes this data as part of the services in compliance with the applicable laws. This of course also includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

For security reasons, Cloudflare also uses a cookie. The cookie (__cfduid) is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address and to apply security settings for each individual user. This cookie is very useful, for example, if you use our website from a location with a number of infected computers. However, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognize this using the cookie. In this way, you can surf through our website unhindered despite infected PCs in the vicinity. It is also important to know that this cookie does not store any personal data. This cookie is essential for the Cloudflare security functions and cannot be deactivated.

### Cookies from Cloudflare

* __cfduid
    * Expiry time: 1 year
    * Use: security settings for each individual visitor
    * Exemplary value: d798bf7df9c1ad5b7583eda5cc5e78311203132

Cloudflare also works with third party providers. They may only process personal data under the instruction of Cloudflare and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other confidentiality and security measures. Cloudflare does not pass on any personal data without our explicit consent.

### How long and where is the data stored?

Cloudflare stores your information primarily in the US and the European Economic Area. Cloudflare can transmit and access the information described above from all over the world. In general, Cloudflare stores data at the user level for domains in the versions Free, Pro and Business for less than 24 hours. For enterprise domains that have activated Cloudflare Logs (formerly Enterprise LogShare or ELS), the data can be stored for up to 7 days. However, if IP addresses trigger security warnings on Cloudflare, there may be exceptions to the storage duration listed above.

### How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?

Cloudflare only stores data logs for as long as necessary and this data is also deleted in most cases within 24 hours. Cloudflare also does not store any personal data, such as your IP address. However, there is information that Cloudflare stores indefinitely as part of its permanent logs in order to improve the overall performance of Cloudflare Resolver and to identify any security risks. You can find out which permanent protocols are saved at [https://www.cloudflare.com/application/privacypolicy/](https://www.cloudflare.com/application/privacypolicy/). All data that Cloudflare collects (temporarily or permanently) is cleaned of all personal data. All permanent logs are also anonymized by Cloudflare.

In their privacy policy, Cloudflare states that they are not responsible for the content they receive. For example, if you ask Cloudflare whether you can update or delete your content, Cloudflare generally refers to us as the website operator. You can also completely prevent the entire collection and processing of your data by Cloudflare by deactivating the execution of script code in your browser or by integrating a script blocker in your browser.

Cloudflare is an active participant in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data. You can find more information on this at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnZKAA0](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnZKAA0&tid=311203132).
